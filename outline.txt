What do we want the game to do?
1.Click spin button to get a fruit that has a corresponding rarity
    a.Store fruit in inventory
    b.Create money system (selling fruits, buying luck boosts or something like that)
    c.Keep track of spins in scoreboard, sort scoreboard by # of spins
2.Have daily reward system
    a.Spinner maybe
3.Have some sort of mini game(s)
    a.??? need idea

How can we do this stuff?
1.Make rarity table and make an RNG function that outputs a rarity for each spin
    a.Use DataStore function in RS, make sure API services are on
    b.Create leaderboard using leaderstats in RS, use DataStore for money
    c.Once again use DataStore in RS and add to leaderboard from before
2.Again we have to do some DataStore magic
3.I have no clue
